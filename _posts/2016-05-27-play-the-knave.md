[Play the Knave](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36076442) is a new type of theater where the players control figures displayed on the screen by bodily movements and voice. This kind of theater created in the realm of virtual reality with an immersive video game is developed by the University of California Davis. The first impression is amazing! I would really love to experience it personally!
