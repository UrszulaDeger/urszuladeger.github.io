<figure class="wp-block-image">![](http://pawlickadeger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Pawlicka-Deger_ad_16102018.jpg)</figure>Find solutions to open science, research data management and copyright issues:

- How to comply with your funders’ and university’s requirements about open access publishing and data management.
- How to find open media on the web and how to define Creative Commons -licences you need.
- How to share code, publish data in the Research Catalogue, get more citations.
- How to apply funding from Aalto Open Access Fund and other funders.
- How to write the Data Management Plan (DMP).
- How to get an ORCID iD and distinguish yourself from other researchers.
- Get to know open access in practice, e.g. the local tools and services we provide you.

We hope to see you there!
