I’m happy to share that my article [“Infrastructuring digital humanities: On relational infrastructure and global reconfiguration of the field”](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/37/2/534/6372159) published in [Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh) has been translated into Chinese and released in the [Digital Humanities Research](http://dhr.ruc.edu.cn/EN/2096-9155/current.shtml) journal. 

The journal is published by the Research Center for Digital Humanities of RUC, a leading research institution in the field of digital humanities in China, which is based at Renmin University of China. Its mission is to promote the development of digital humanities research based on the international academic frontier, build a platform for academic exchange, and promote the integration of humanities and science and technology.

The translation has been made by Jianan Guo from the Research Center for Digital Humanities of RUC. I hope the Chinese-speaking audience will find the article interesting and useful. The translated article can be found [here](http://dhr.ruc.edu.cn/EN/Y2023/V3/I1/24).
