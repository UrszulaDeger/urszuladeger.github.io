The Modern Language Association launched a project of [Humanities Commons](https://hcommons.org/) which is a nonprofit network where humanities scholars can create a professional profile, discuss common interests, develop new publications, and share their work. The network is open to anyone working in or adjacent to the humanities.

Humanities Commons was designed by scholarly societies in the humanities to serve the needs of humanists as they engage in teaching and research that benefit the larger community. Unlike other social and academic communities, Humanities Commons is open-access, open-source, and nonprofit. It is focused on providing a space to discuss, share, and store cutting-edge research and innovative pedagogy—not on generating profits from users’ intellectual and personal data.

The network also includes the [Commons Open Repository Exchange ](https://hcommons.org/core/)(CORE) which is a full-text, interdisciplinary, non-profit social repository designed to increase the impact of work in the Humanities.

I have already logged in the network, so let’s experience a new platform for the humanities!
