If you are looking for reliable comparison between the humanities, natural science and social science, I would recommend you to look into a book “The Three Cultures” by Jerome Kagan (Cambridge University Press 2009). Below I have attached images of table (pp. 4-5), containing concise and helpful characterization of these three areas.
