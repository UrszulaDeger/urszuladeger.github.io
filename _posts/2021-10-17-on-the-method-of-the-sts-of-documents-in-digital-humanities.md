I’ve published a new blog post ‘[On the Method of the “STS of Documents” in Digital Humanities](https://dhinfra.org/268/on-the-method-of-the-sts-of-documents-in-digital-humanities/)‘ on my research website [dhinfra.org](https://dhinfra.org). In that post, I outline my ongoing ethnographic research at King’s Digital Lab and study of documents produced by the lab. Based on the analysis of 40 ‘Feasibility documents’, I have aimed to understand how they inform the lab management work and how they contribute to structuring the digital research process. To this end, I apply the method of the ‘STS of documents’ and analyse Feasibility documents in a manner similar to STS-based studies of scientific labs’ protocols and kits. The outcome of my analysis will be published in the Convergence special issue ‘[Critical Technical Practice(s) in Digital Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/pb-assets/Convergence_Special%20Issue_CTP%20in%20Digital%20Research.pdf)‘. In the forthcoming article, I intend to show that documents can be studied as ethnographic objects that can help to reveal critical and socio-technical practices entangled with operational methods and local requirements. In the blog post, in turn, I reflect on the lab management and workflow by referring to a research project conducted in collaboration with King’s Digital Lab.
