How is the humanities attached to a place? Why does the space of scholarly practices matter? How do new spaces of humanities inquiry (e.g., laboratories and makerspaces) both transform and drive the research and teaching practices? These questions are a starting point for my current research on the role of space for humanities work. I am conducting this study at the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) at the University of Birmingham. This coming Wednesday, 13th November, I will give a public lecture “Place Matters: Exploring New Sites of the Humanities Practices” at the IAS. This is a great opportunity for me to share and discuss my preliminary results. In the last weeks, I have been writing an article under the same title which hopefully will be soon finalized and submitted for publication.

You can find the abstract of my talk on the [IAS website](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/ias/workshops/2019/Place-Matters.aspx). I particularly love the [poster](https://pawlickadeger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Pawlicka-Place-Matters_IAS_Talk-Stg220461.pdf)! I found this image at the [Europeana Collections](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200579/g4w9q949.html?q=laboratory#dcId=1569564803982&p=1) and thought it is a perfect suit to my topic. The picture shows women and men at the chemical laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. It is from 1880 and represents wood engraving techniques. Such a great treasure!
