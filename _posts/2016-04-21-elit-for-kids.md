One of the areas of electronic literature is digital works for children. As [Leonardo Flores](http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=11228) said, children’s e-literature help to develop digital literacy, related to reading digital text, coding, designing, and navigation in digital environment, to name just a few. The examples of kid’s electronic literature are kinetic text *Anipoemas* by Ana María Uribe, playable works *Enigma n* by Jim Andrews, and language-art work *Unicode Infinite* by Jörg Piringer. Electronic literature for children was the part of conference “The End(s) of Electronic Literature”, organized by Electronic Literature Organization at the University of Bergen last year. [Kid E-Lit exhibition](http://www.uib.no/en/rg/electronicliterature/89950/kid-e-lit-exhibition-electronic-literature-children-and-youth) was presented at Bergen Public Library in August and September 2015.

You can read about the children’s eLit in the following books, such as *E-literature for Children: Enhancing Digital Literacy Learning* by Len Unsworth (2005), and *Digital Literature for Children. Texts, Readers and Educational Practices*, edited by Mireia Manresa and Neus Real (2015). Besides website “[Little eLit](https://littleelit.com/)” (Young Children, New Media &amp; Libraries), now you can follow blog “[eLit 4 kids](http://elit4kids.blogspot.com/)” (apps &amp; other digital literature for children), running by Mark C. Marino, Professor at the University of Southern California, where he directs the Humanities and Critical Code Studies (HaCCS) Lab; a scholar of digital literature, and an author of codework, digital, and Netprov projects.
