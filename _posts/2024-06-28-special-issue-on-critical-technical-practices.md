The long-awaited special issue on critical technical practices in digital research and beyond has been published in the [Convergence journal](https://publicdatalab.org/projects/pluralising-critical-technical-practices/). I'm pleased to contribute to this issue with an article on the critical study of documents produced in digital research production. I propose using the method of the "STS of documents" to analyse feasibility documents that aim to assess technical and design requirements based on research questions and to organise a project workflow. It is an open-access publication, so you can find it here: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565221111073](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565221111073)
