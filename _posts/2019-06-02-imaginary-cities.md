The British Library displays a wonderful exhibition created by artist Michael Takeo Magruder. “[Imaginary Cities](https://www.bl.uk/press-releases/2019/april/imaginary-cities)” is the transformation of the British Library’s online collection of historic urban maps into fictional cityspaces for the Information Age.

<figure class="wp-block-image">![](https://pawlickadeger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-700x435.jpg)</figure>The exhibition comprises four technology-based art installations, exclusively created using images and metadata of 19th-century city maps drawn from the Library’s “[One Million Images from Scanned Books](https://www.flickr.com/photos/britishlibrary/)” collection on Flickr Commons. It is an impressive and beautiful artwork! It shows how digitised cultural materials can be reused in a creative way and give rise to unique born-digital artifacts. “[The exhibition highlights how the Library is not simply a repository of knowledge, but a storehouse of creative potential that is constantly generating new avenues for culture](https://www.bl.uk/events/imaginary-cities)”.
