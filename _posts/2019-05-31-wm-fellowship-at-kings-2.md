The past few weeks were intensive, busy, and exciting! I visited the Department of Digital Humanities (DDH) at King’s College London on a [Willard McCarty fellowship](https://blogs.kcl.ac.uk/ddh/willard-mccarty-fellowship/). It was a great pleasure to meet the academic staff and share research interests and experience. Thanks for all inspiring talks!

The event was chaired by Arianna Ciula (Deputy Director &amp; Senior Research Software Analyst, KDL) and introduced by Prof. Willard McCarty. Next, James Smithies (Director, KDL; Deputy Director, KCL eResearch) gave a talk about a laboratory in the context of postphenomenology and presented King’s Digital Lab as socio-technical system. After that, Jonathan Gray (Co-founder of the Public Data Lab, and Lecturer in Critical Infrastructure Studies, DDH) reflected on the development of the Public Data Lab, a unique model of lab as a network of researchers and research centres from across Europe established around questions of the data society. After that, I presented my recent work on humanities laboratories from the perspective of laboratory studies, critical infrastructure studies, and social lab theorists. The resources and photos will be soon published on the WM Fellowship’s website. Meanwhile, you can find my presentation under the “Materials” section!
