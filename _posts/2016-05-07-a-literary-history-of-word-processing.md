[*Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing* ](http://www.amazon.com/Track-Changes-Literary-History-Processing/dp/0674417070/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1459569683&sr=8-2&keywords=kirschenbaum)by Matthew G. Kirschenbaum is finally released! Along with it, it is published its first review written by [Dylan Hicks](https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/type-slowly-word-processing-and-literary-composition/) for “Los Angeles Review of Books”. “\[book\] is especially concerned with how word processing has changed the embodied labor of writing — its actual tasks, tools, and physical demands — and with how literary writers have embraced, resisted, and interpreted that transformation”. Track Changes is a fundamental reading in the field of digital humanities, comparative textual media, and electronic literature.
