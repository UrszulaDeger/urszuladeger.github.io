Great to see that my article “The Laboratory Turn: Exploring Discourses, Landscapes, and Models of Humanities Labs” (*Digital Humanities Quarterly*, 2021:14.3) has been reposted on the Digital Humanities Program of Tsinghua University website. The team of this program established the first digital humanities journal (*Journal of Digital Humanities*, 《数字人文》, quarterly ) in the mainland of China in 2019. [Here](https://www.dhlib.cn/site/works/papers/type/cyberinfrastructure_paper/16318.html) is the link.
