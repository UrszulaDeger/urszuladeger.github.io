I’m excited to share that my new piece, “Digital humanities needs equality between humanists and technicians”, has been published in *Times Higher Education*. It is about labour issues and recognition that are becoming increasingly salient in digital humanities labs. As I argue, introducing a fair publication policy, such [as the one recently published by King’s](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/governancezone/research/fair-publication-policy), is a step towards assuring that the work performed by research technicians and technology and skills specialists is acknowledged in research outputs. Recognition of contribution is a prerequisite for research production.
