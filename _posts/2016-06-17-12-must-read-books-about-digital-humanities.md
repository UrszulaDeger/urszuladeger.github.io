Must-read books about digital humanities are as follow:

- *A Companion to Digital Humanities, ed. Susan Schreibman*, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth (Wiley-Blackwell, 2008)
- *Switching Codes: Thinking Through Digital Technology in the Humanities and the Arts*, ed. Thomas Bartscherer, Roderick Coover (University of Chicago Press, 2011)
- *[Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/)*, ed. Matthew Gold (2012)
- *Digital\_Humanities*, ed. Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner, Jeffrey Schnapp (The MIT Press, 2012)
- *Understanding Digital Humanities*, ed. by D. Berry (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012)
- *Collaborative Research in the Digital Humanities,* ed. by Willard McCarty, Marilyn Deegan (Routledge, 2012)
- *Digital Humanities Pedagogy: Practices,* Principles *and Politics* by Brett D. Hirsch (Open Book Publishers, 2012)
- *The Emergence of the Digital Humanities*, Steven E. Jones (Routledge, 2013)
- *Comparative Textual Media: Transforming the Humanities in the Postprint Era*, ed. N. Katherine Hayles, Jessica Pressman (Univ Of Minnesota Press, 2013)
- *Interdisciplining Digital Humanities: Boundary Work in an Emerging Field* by Julie Thompson Klein (University of Michigan Press, 2015)

This above list is expanded by the next publications released in this year, such as *Defining Digital Humanities* by Melissa Terras, Julianne Nyhan, and Edward Vanhoutte (Routledge, 2014), and *A New Companion to Digital Humanities* edited by Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth (Blackwell, 2016).

I especially recommend the last position *A New Companion to Digital Humanities* which in comparison with the previous version presents comprehensively various areas of digital humanities, called as a “discipline in its own right”, rather than a set of related methods. Besides the description of digital tools and projects, what was typical for the first publications about digital humanities, it focuses on critical analysis of digital humanities (e.g. *Ancient Evenings: Retrocomputing in the Digital Humanities* by Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, *Interface as Mediating Actor for Collection Access, Text Analysis, and Experimentation* by Stan Ruecker, and *Gendering Digital Literary History: What Counts for Digital Humanities* by Laura C. Mandell). What is interesting for me, the edition includes, for the first time, articles devoted to the relationships between digital humanities and electronic literature, such as *Exploratory Programming in Digital Humanities Pedagogy and Research* by Nick Montfort and *Electronic Literature as Digital Humanities* by Scott Rettberg.
