This Thursday, on 4th April, I will be giving a talk together with Dr Mila Oiva (from the University of Turku) at the [Digital Humanities Research Seminar](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-centre-for-digital-humanities/digital-humanities-research-seminar-0) at the University of Helsinki. Our presentation, titled “Lab and Slack. Situated Research Practices in Digital Humanities” is an overview of our special issue of “Digital Humanities Quarterly”. We have been working on this special issue for a year and collecting articles about physical and virtual situatedness of research practices in DH. We have more than 15 papers written by scholars working at digital humanities places, including Yale University, Michigan State University, the University of Victoria, Portland State University, and the University of Luxembourg! The special issue will be submitted soon to the DHQ and hopefully, released at the end of this year!
