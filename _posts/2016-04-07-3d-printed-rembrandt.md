“[The Next Rembrandt](https://www.nextrembrandt.com/)” is astounding [3D-printed Rembrandt](http://mashable.com/2016/04/06/3d-printed-rembrandt/#ZBA.06N_qqqn) painting designed by a team of developers with the technical support of Microsoft and backing from Dutch bank ING. The aim of project was to create new work “made by Rembrandt” by using data from his existing paintings. Designed software system recognizes Rembrandt based on his use of geometry, composition, and painting materials. Then software replicates his style and also generates new facial features what was probably the biggest challenge. Distilling the artistic DNA from piece to create new work shows again incredible capabilities of new technology, software system, digital tools and “big data” in the art and humanities.
