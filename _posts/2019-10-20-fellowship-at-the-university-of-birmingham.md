I am very happy to share that I have been awarded the [Vanguard Fellowship ](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/ias/vanguard-fellowship-programme/2019/Pawlicka-Deger.aspx)at the Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Birmingham. I will visit the [Liberal Arts and Natural Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/liberal-arts-and-sciences/index.aspx) from 20 October to 24 November 2019. The next five weeks will be very exciting and busy! I will give a public lecture, titled “Place Matters: Exploring New Sites of the Humanities Practices” and co-organize a workshop “[Rebuilding Laboratories](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/ias/workshops/2019/rebuilding-laboratories.aspx)”. I am very much looking forward to inspiring discussions on interdisciplinarity, knowledge production, and laboratories!
