I am very pleased to announce that, in February, I was awarded a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship by the European Commission for my project “Digital Humanities Laboratory: Studying the Entanglement of Infrastructure and Technology in Knowledge Production”. I will conduct my research at King’s Digital Lab at King’s College London.

For my research, I propose to conduct a novel ethnographic study of digital humanists at work, combined with a critical analysis of local infrastructure. This project has three main objectives: the epistemological goal is to develop a new theoretical framework for examining a laboratory in Digital Humanities drawing on Science and Technology Studies and Knowledge Infrastructures; the methodological task aims at integrating laboratory ethnography and the ethnography of infrastructure to build a new toolset for studying the intertwining of human organisation and infrastructure; and the central work focuses on investigating Digital Humanities knowledge creation mainly based on a case study of King’s Digital Lab. The study will be based on the observation of, and interviews with, participants involved in the labs, the analysis of written documents, and the analysis of digital communications. As part of this project, I will organize seminars and workshops and publish scholarly articles and methodological guidance. I am really excited to start the project!
