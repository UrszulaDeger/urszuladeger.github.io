It is a strange feeling to know that this is our last week in Finland! These four years have passed so quickly and brought a lot of changes to my life. It has been a wonderful time to live in such a beautiful and peaceful country, work at Aalto University, and meet great colleagues. I am pleased that my postdoctoral position has given me a lot of different experiences and allowed me to delve into new topics and research interests, including digital humanities knowledge production, research infrastructure, and data management practices. It is really strange to begin a new fellowship and change countries during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic but I am very excited packing up all the stuff and sending them to our new place… in London! So, the next stop is London where I will begin a Marie Curie Fellowship at King’s College London. I am very happy to become a Marie Curie Fellow and conduct my research at King’s Digital Lab!
