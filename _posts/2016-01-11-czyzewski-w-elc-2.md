It is nice to hear that my project, created together with Łukasz Podgórni (programming and design), “[Oczy tygrysa (The Eyes of the Tiger)](http://ha.art.pl/czyzewski/). Adaptation of Formist Tytus Czyzewski’s poetry” (Corporation Ha!art, 2012) is going to be included in the third Electronic Literature Collection. It is the first time when polish electronic literature will be presented in this international anthology of e-lit. ELC3 will be released in this February. I cannot wait to see the effects!
