As part of my Marie Curie research, I conducted a set of interviews with members of King’s Digital Lab, management staff and researchers involved in the lab work. Discussions revolved around the institutional, research, and socio-technical infrastructure of King’s College London and King’s Digital Lab, the social practices of digital projects, the use of digital tools in everyday research practices and the challenges of conducting research with regard to the lab management, organisation, policies, and facilities. The transcripts of the interviews are available in Zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/record/7880810).
