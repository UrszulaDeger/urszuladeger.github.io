I have recently joined the [Global Outlook::Digital Humanities](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/) [Translation Board](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/translation-board/)! The GO::DH aims to make all resources available in languages other than English. It is important for building truly global DH. As a member, I will translate the organizationâ€™s announcements, publications, and projects into the Polish language.
