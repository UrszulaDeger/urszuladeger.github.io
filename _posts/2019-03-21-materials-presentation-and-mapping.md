In the “Materials” section, I have uploaded my presentation “[Mapping a History of the Humanities and Media Labs](https://pawlickadeger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pawlicka-Deger_Mapping_Humanities_and_Media_Labs.pdf)” which I am showing today, on March 21, at the Global Digital Humanities Symposium at Michigan State University. You can also find a link to an interactive map of “[(Digital) Humanities and Media Labs around the world](http://pawlickadeger.com/humanities-labs/)” created in StoryMapJS tool. The map will be available for a week so please feel free to explore it! If you have any comments or suggestions, please email me: urszula.pawlicka@aalto.fi
