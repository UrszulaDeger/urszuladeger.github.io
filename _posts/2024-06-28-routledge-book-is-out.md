It's been a while since I last posted, and quite a lot of things have happened. One thing is the publication of my book, “Digital Humanities and Laboratories: Perspectives on Knowledge, Infrastructure and Culture” by Routledge at the beginning of this year. You can find out more about the book at the [Routledge website](https://www.routledge.com/Digital-Humanities-and-Laboratories-Perspectives-on-Knowledge-Infrastructure-and-Culture/Pawlicka-Deger-Thomson/p/book/9781032027630). In short, it aims to explore laboratories dedicated to the study of digital humanities (DH) in a global context and contribute to the expanding body of knowledge about situated DH knowledge production. I'm proud of this book and honoured to have a foreword by Prof. David Berry. The book features contributions from a diverse, international range of scholars and practitioners. Some chapters are available on an open-access basis, including an introduction by Christopher Thomson and me. So please check them out here: https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9781003185932/digital-humanities-laboratories-christopher-thomson-urszula-pawlicka-deger
