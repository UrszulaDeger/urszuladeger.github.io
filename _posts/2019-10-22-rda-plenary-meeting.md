Together with my team of Data Agents working in the [Research Data Management Support Initiative ](https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/introduction-to-research-data-management-rdm-and-open-science)at Aalto University, we presented our work and activities at the [Research Data Alliance’s 14th Plenary Meeting](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rdas-14th-plenary-helsinki-finland) taking place from 23-25 October 2019 in Helsinki. It is great to share our efforts and achievements in managing research data better and making data open for everyone!
