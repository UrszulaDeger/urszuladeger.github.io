I am a Research Manager in the Discovery Research programme at Wellcome Trust. Wellcome is a London-based science research foundation supporting curiosity-driven research across different fields to transform understanding of human life, health, and wellbeing. Prior to that, I was a Marie Curie Research Fellow at King’s Digital Lab at King’s College London, UK and a Fulbright Alumna at Washington State University Vancouver, US.

I’ve been conducting an ethnography of digital humanities laboratory to investigate social practices and the entanglement of infrastructure and technology in knowledge production. My forthcoming books include “Digital Humanities and Laboratories” (Routledge 2023) and “Critical Infrastructure Studies and Digital Humanities (University of Minnesota Press). See the “publications” section for more details.

I’ve worked at the intersection of digital humanities and science, technology and society (STS). My interests include knowledge production studies, laboratory experiments in the humanities, knowledge infrastructure and collaborative research culture.
