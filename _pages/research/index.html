It will bring infrastructural approaches front and center as an area where DH is uniquely equipped to lead the humanities in thought and practice, using its own infrastructural legacy as inspiration and mirror. The aim is to understand how infrastructure underpins and influences DH, and how DH in turn can influence infrastructure design, development, and maintenance. The volume will promote understanding of critical infrastructure studies as a field of writing and practice, and open dialogues between DH and cognate infrastructural fields.

This project has three main objectives: the epistemological goal is to develop a new theoretical framework for examining a laboratory in Digital Humanities drawing on Science and Technology Studies and Knowledge Infrastructures; the methodological task aims at integrating laboratory ethnography and the ethnography of infrastructure to build a new toolset for studying the intertwining of human organisation and infrastructure; and the central work focuses on investigating Digital Humanities knowledge creation mainly based on a case study of King’s Digital Lab. The study will be based on the observation of, and interviews with, participants involved in the labs, the analysis of written documents, and the analysis of digital communications. As part of this project, I will organize seminars and workshops and publish scholarly articles and methodological guidance.</p> <p>You can find more about my research on <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/891155" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CORDIS European Commission </a>website and in my blog post <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/blog/behind-text/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“What is happening behind the text?”</a> published at King’s Digital Lab website.</p> <p><strong>* **Place Matters: Exploring Spaces for the Humanities Practices</strong></p> <p><em>From the 1980s, science and technology studies and the history of science have turned their attention to spaces for the experiments and production of knowledge. All sites of scientific inquiry have become objects of exploration to comprehend the interweaving of place and knowledge. With the publication of</em> Laboratory Life <em>by Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar in 1979, a laboratory, in particular, has been considered as a gateway for understanding how scientific knowledge is constructed. Karin Knorr Cetina, Peter Galison, and David N. Livingstone, among others, sought to answer the following seminal questions: How does a space of inquiry determine the investigations carried out there? How is scientific knowledge created in a particular place? How do the buildings and sites entail specific practices and values and how do they shape the identity of researchers and fields? A place is endowed with the power of the transformation of the field as well as serves as evidence for these changes. While the study of scientific spaces is well-grounded, a discussion of the intertwining of place and the humanities knowledge has been largely unexplored. The rise of laboratories and makerspaces in the humanities, however, provokes us to ask similar questions: how these new spaces of humanities inquiry both transform and drive humanities research and teaching practices?</em></p> <p>This project was conducted as part of the Vanguard Fellowship at the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) at the University of Birmingham (Autumn 2019) and presented at a <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/ias/workshops/2019/Place-Matters.aspx" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">public lecture</a> at the IAS on 13 November 2019. You can find the presentation of my talk <a href="https://pawlickadeger.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Place_matters_Pawlicka-Deger.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>The article “Place Matters: Thinking about Spaces for the Humanities Practices” has been published open access in <em>Arts and Humanities in Higher Education</em>, 20.3 (2021), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1474022220961750" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1177/1474022220961750</a>.</p> <ul> <li>The Laboratory Turn: Exploring Discourses, Landscapes, and Models of Humanities Labs**</li> </ul> <p><em>The goal of this research is to track the path of the formation of the laboratory turn in the humanities and understand the conditions, meanings, and functions of humanities labs. First, I investigate three discourses that gave rise to the emergence of a laboratory in the humanities: the transformation of the humanities infrastructure within the university, paradigm shifts in the social sciences, and the expansion of cultural categories of innovation, the maker movement (the proliferation of makerspaces), and the idea of community. Next, I present a history of the laboratory in the humanities and determine the shift from a laboratory as a physical place to a conceptual laboratory. Further, I analyze five models for humanities labs based on laboratories’ statements and operations: the center-type lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab. The research shows that the laboratory turn has emerged in the humanities as a part of a wider process of the laboratorization of social life, which has been occurring since the 1980s. Next, the study indicates the role of digital humanities as the driving force behind building a laboratory space, which supports situated practices, collaborative, and technology-based projects. I aim to show that the humanities lab does not simply imitate the science lab but adapts this new infrastructure for its own purposes and needs.</em></p> <p>This research was conducted in the Department of Media at Aalto University (2017-2020).
